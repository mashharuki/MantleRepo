What's Next? 
Based on the various requests during hackathons, we experimented with thirdweb's SDK. thirdweb's stack is one of the best ways to quickly ship cool dApps and based on feedback, we might have some really cool dApps being shipped in the form of a series! 

In conclusion, Mantle is a powerful solution for developers looking to build high-performance dApps on Ethereum's layer-2 network. Its modular architecture, low fees, and high-security features make it a great option for builders who want to provide an exceptional user experience for their users. 

Currently, building on Mantle's testnet offers numerous benefits, such as the ability to test and experiment with dApps in a safe environment without incurring high gas costs. As Mantle continues to develop and expand, it promises to be a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, providing developers with the tools they need to build innovative and scalable dApps.

Feel free to reach out to our DevRel team for tech support or any queries while building the dApp!
